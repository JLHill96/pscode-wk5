// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Have user input two(2) numbers
Label the two(2) inputs A and B respectively
Mathematically add both inputs A and B
Print result of mathematical addition

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Have user input any number
Take user input and divide that input by two(2)
If remainder, print odd
If no remainder, print even

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

A. Have User input any five(5) numbers

B. Take all five(5) user inputs and mathematically add them together (ex 1+2+3+4+5)
Take sum from previous step and mathematically divide the sum by five(5)
Print result

C. Take user input and determine which numbers are closest to zero(0)
Positive number that is closest to Zero(0), print smallest
Positive number that is furthest from Zero(0), print largest
If input is a negative number, determine which numbers are closest to zero(0)
Negative number that is closest to Zero(0), print Largest
Negative number that is furthest from Zero(0), print smallest
If input contains both positive and negative numbers, prioritize positive numbers as larger than negative numbers.
